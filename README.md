# WordScramble

This project is a game where a word has been picked by the computer and we need to make as many words as possible by rearranging them.

Features are:
* Checks whether the entered string is a word in the dictionary
* Checks whether all the letters belong in the given word
* Checks for repitition of the word

**TODO**
* Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
* Add a left bar button item that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
* Put a text view below the List so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. 
* Add a Timer to finish a game within the specified time
